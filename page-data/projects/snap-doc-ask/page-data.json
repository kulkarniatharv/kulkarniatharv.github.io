This mobile application allows users to capture document images or select them from a gallery, extract text via OCR, and interact with this text through a state-of-the-art language model.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe core functionality of \"Snap Doc & Ask\" revolves around its user-friendly chat-like interface. Users can either capture a document directly through the camera or upload up to five images from their gallery. Google ML Kit is employed to perform OCR on these images, converting visual data into editable and queryable text.\n\n![Image: Initial screen](../assets/images/snapdocask/initial-screen.jpg)\n\nOnce the text is captured, users can pose questions directly related to the OCR-generated text. These inquiries are then processed by a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), which offers detailed responses. The interaction doesn't just stop at a single exchange; users can continue the conversation, asking follow-up questions. Each query and its corresponding responses are passed to the LLM via a robust API, ensuring that even follow-up questions consider the context of the entire conversation history.\n\n![Image: Chat with text](../assets/images/snapdocask/chat-with-ocr-text.jpg)\n\n---\n\n![Image: Chat History](../assets/images/snapdocask/previous-chats.jpg)\n\n## Unique Features\n\n- **Efficient Text Handling:** Streamline the interaction with documents by allowing text extraction and direct queries on the extracted text.\n- **Seamless User Experience:** Operates like a chat application, making it intuitive and easy to use.\n- **Smart Interaction:** Leveraging a state-of-the-art LLM to answer queries based on the document's text.\n- **Secure and Private:** User authentication via Firebase ensures that chats are private and secure. Additionally, users can delete conversations, which are then permanently removed from the Firebase database.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\"Snap Doc & Ask\" is not just an app but a revolutionary tool designed to make document handling as effortless as possible. By integrating advanced OCR with intelligent conversational AI, this app opens new avenues for interacting with textual content, making it an indispensable tool for professionals and students alike.","frontmatter":{"title":"Snap Doc & Ask: Efficient Document Interaction","description":"An innovative mobile app that combines OCR with AI to allow users to interact with document texts through a conversational interface.","imagesUrl":[{"relativePath":"snapdocask/initial-screen.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1965ba735b6910736a78ac2ddf21a557/564fc/initial-screen.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1965ba735b6910736a78ac2ddf21a557/84d67/initial-screen.jpg 270w,\n/static/1965ba735b6910736a78ac2ddf21a557/54111/initial-screen.jpg 540w,\n/static/1965ba735b6910736a78ac2ddf21a557/564fc/initial-screen.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(min-width: 1080px) 1080px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1965ba735b6910736a78ac2ddf21a557/44735/initial-screen.webp 270w,\n/static/1965ba735b6910736a78ac2ddf21a557/ae545/initial-screen.webp 540w,\n/static/1965ba735b6910736a78ac2ddf21a557/3f73d/initial-screen.webp 1080w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1080px) 1080px, 100vw"}]},"width":1080,"height":2193}}},{"relativePath":"snapdocask/chat-with-ocr-text.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a557be5095281b38aba302b0dbc3da71/8bbf6/chat-with-ocr-text.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a557be5095281b38aba302b0dbc3da71/04123/chat-with-ocr-text.jpg 270w,\n/static/a557be5095281b38aba302b0dbc3da71/21375/chat-with-ocr-text.jpg 540w,\n/static/a557be5095281b38aba302b0dbc3da71/8bbf6/chat-with-ocr-text.jpg 1079w","sizes":"(min-width: 1079px) 1079px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a557be5095281b38aba302b0dbc3da71/ea544/chat-with-ocr-text.webp 270w,\n/static/a557be5095281b38aba302b0dbc3da71/6ca25/chat-with-ocr-text.webp 540w,\n/static/a557be5095281b38aba302b0dbc3da71/886d6/chat-with-ocr-text.webp 1079w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1079px) 1079px, 100vw"}]},"width":1079,"height":2199}}},{"relativePath":"snapdocask/previous-chats.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5e2c1e02865ec331d934c6bb6c658858/d61ea/previous-chats.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5e2c1e02865ec331d934c6bb6c658858/f7f9d/previous-chats.jpg 269w,\n/static/5e2c1e02865ec331d934c6bb6c658858/4b227/previous-chats.jpg 539w,\n/static/5e2c1e02865ec331d934c6bb6c658858/d61ea/previous-chats.jpg 1077w","sizes":"(min-width: 1077px) 1077px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5e2c1e02865ec331d934c6bb6c658858/55cb1/previous-chats.webp 269w,\n/static/5e2c1e02865ec331d934c6bb6c658858/0f8a0/previous-chats.webp 539w,\n/static/5e2c1e02865ec331d934c6bb6c658858/934de/previous-chats.webp 1077w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1077px) 1077px, 100vw"}]},"width":1077,"height":2197}}}],"sections":["generative-AI"],"techStack":["Firebase","Google ML Kit","Java"],"duration":"","role":"","repoLink":""}}},"pageContext":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"snap-doc-ask","sections":["generative-AI"],"description":"An innovative mobile app that combines OCR with AI to allow users to interact with document texts through a conversational interface."},"slug":"snap-doc-ask"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1985435631"],"slicesMap":{}}
